[![CI](https://github.com/ai-devops-learning/.github/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ai-devops-learning/.github/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Organization-wide defaults for **ai-devops-learning**: community health files,
issue and PR templates, the public organization profile, and reusable GitHub
Actions workflow templates.

A repository that has its own copy of a community health file uses that copy
instead of the default here.
See [GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

## Workflow templates

In any repository in the organization, go to **Actions → New workflow** and
look for the section *By ai-devops-learning*.

| Template | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [Node.js CI](workflow-templates/node-ci.yml) | `npm ci`, lint, test, and build across Node 20/22/24 |
| [Python CI](workflow-templates/python-ci.yml) | ruff and pytest across Python 3.11–3.13 |
| [Docker publish (GHCR)](workflow-templates/docker-publish.yml) | Multi-arch build and push to ghcr.io with SBOM, provenance, and attestation |
| [CodeQL analysis](workflow-templates/codeql.yml) | Security code scanning (`security-extended` queries) |
| [Dependency review](workflow-templates/dependency-review.yml) | Blocks PRs that add vulnerable or AGPL dependencies |
| [OpenSSF Scorecard](workflow-templates/scorecard.yml) | Supply-chain security posture score |
| [Lint workflows](workflow-templates/actionlint.yml) | actionlint on `.github/workflows/` |
| [Semantic PR title](workflow-templates/semantic-pr-title.yml) | Enforces Conventional Commits PR titles |
| [Stale](workflow-templates/stale.yml) | Closes inactive issues and PRs |
| [Issues as code](workflow-templates/issues-as-code.yml) | Creates issues (and Project cards) from `issues/*.md` files. Needs the companion script; see below |

Every template follows the same hardening baseline:

- Actions pinned to full commit SHAs
- Least-privilege `permissions`
- `persist-credentials: false` on checkout
- Job timeouts
- Concurrency cancellation for superseded PR runs

> Workflow templates are available to all repositories when this `.github`
> repository is **public**. A private `.github` repository shares templates only
> on GitHub Enterprise plans.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`create_issues.py`](scripts/create_issues.py) | Issues as code: creates a GitHub issue for each `issues/<slug>.md` that doesn't have one yet, and optionally adds it to a Projects v2 board. Create-only: it never edits or closes existing issues. |

To use issues as code in your repository:

1. Copy `scripts/create_issues.py` and the `issues/` folder into your
   repository.
2. Add the *Issues as code* workflow from **Actions → New workflow**.
3. Write one `issues/<slug>.md` file per issue, open a PR, and merge.

See [issues/README.md](issues/README.md) for the file format and rules.

## Contributing

Changes here affect every repository in the organization. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (template rules
and validation commands). The `significant changes` process in
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) applies to template and policy changes.
